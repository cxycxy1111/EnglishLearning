乔伊：少来了，你和那个人一起出去！拜托，和你交往的男人一定有问题！
Chandler: All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
钱德勒：打住，乔伊，嘴下留德。他驼背？既驼背又带假发？
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?
菲比：慢着，他吃粉笔吗？
(They all stare, bemused.)

钱德勒：我只想要一百万！（满怀希望地伸出手。）

女服务员：想来杯咖啡吗？

Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
莫妮卡：你想现在告诉我们，还是等四位湿淋淋的伴娘来再说？
Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee) Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
瑞秋：天啊……婚礼前半个小时发生了变数。我在堆放礼物的房间里，看着船形卤肉盘，非常漂亮的船形卤肉盘，突然间……（对送咖啡的女服务员）有没有代糖？我发现船形卤肉盘比巴瑞更能引起我的“性趣”，我自己都吓了一跳，巴瑞愈看愈像猪头先生。我一直都认为他很眼熟。总之，我必须离开。我开始想，我为何这么做？我为谁这样做？于是我不知该走往何处，我知道你我日渐疏远，但你是我在这个城市认识的唯一一个人。
Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
莫妮卡：好像是唯一没受邀参加婚礼的人。
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
瑞秋：这件事就甭提啦。
[Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]

(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)
（剧中女人被推下楼，众人欢呼。）
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
瑞秋：爸，你听我说……大家这样评价我这一辈子：你是一只鞋……今天我倒想看看如果我不再是鞋会怎样。我说如果我想当皮包呢？或是帽子呢？不，我不需你帮我买帽子。我说我是一顶帽子。爸，这是一种比喻。
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.
罗斯：你看他也有些理解不了。
Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
瑞秋：爸，这是我的人生。或许我会和莫妮卡住在这儿。
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
莫妮卡：我想我们已确定好谁要和莫妮卡住在这儿了。

莫妮卡：深呼吸，就这样。试着想着美好的事物……
Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
菲比：（唱歌）玫瑰上的雨滴，猫嘴上的胡须，门铃和雪橇之类的。啦 啦 啦……还有手套……

Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!

Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
莫妮卡：或许这样最好，要自立，决定自己的事情。关于那个“帽子”的比喻。
Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
乔伊：（安慰她）有任何需要找乔伊准没错。我和钱德勒就住在对面，而且他经常不在家。

Joey: Who's Paul?

罗斯：我懂，你没去成蜜月。虽然阿鲁巴在这个时候……有很多……大蜥蜴。如果你今晚不想独处，乔伊和钱德勒要到我那儿帮我组装新家具。

[场景：罗斯的公寓，几个男人正在组装家具。]
Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.

Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
保罗：我知道，我是个大白痴。她每周看四五次牙医时我就该明白，牙齿能有多干净？
Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?

Monica: You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
莫妮卡：你真的砸烂过她的表？哇！我做过的最坏的事情是，我撕碎了男朋友最喜欢的浴巾。
Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.

[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]

Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The machine cuts her off again and she redials.)
瑞秋：巴瑞，真是对不起……你一定认为此事与我那次说的话有关，关于你做爱时穿着袜子，其实不是，问题出在我身上，我……（电话被挂断，重新拨号）嗨，答录机又把我挂断了。不管怎样……瞧瞧，我知道某个女孩会不可思议地成为巴瑞·芬克尔太太，但那不是我，不是我。而我现在连我自己是谁都不知道，但你还应该给我一个机会向你……（又被挂断，再次拨号）
[Scene: Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]

钱德勒：你还是停下来吧！（钱德勒用锤子砸向正在组装的东西，它散架了。）
Ross: That only took me an hour.
罗斯：我才花了一小时组装的。
Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
钱德勒：看啊，罗斯，你应该理解，我们认识这么久，却没有一段感情能维持超过一根曼妥思糖的时间。而你，却拥有过一个女人四年的爱。四年的亲密与分享，最后她却伤透了你的心，这就是我们为什么不谈恋爱！我好像不是这个意思！
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
罗斯：你知道最可怕的是什么？万一每个人一生只有一个真爱怎么办？我的意思是如果你遇到了那个唯一的女人——然后就没有然后了？不幸的是，我生命中的那个唯一，却把她的唯一给了别人……
Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
乔伊：你在说什么？一个女人？那就像在说你只能吃一种口味的冰淇淋。罗斯，告诉你吧，冰淇淋的口味有千百种。有摇滚之路（巧克力碎坚果口味）、曲奇面团口味、冰沁樱桃香草口味！你可以加上糖针、坚果或者奶油！这是你一生中最美好的事！你多大就结婚了，八岁？欢迎回到自由世界！抓住机会（拿起勺子）！
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
罗斯：我真的不知道自己是饥渴还是欲火焚身？
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer!

Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
莫妮卡：（震惊地喷出口中的饮料）天啊，天啊，对不起，对不起。
Paul: It's okay...
保罗：没关系……
Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
莫妮卡：你现在需要的应该不是让人吐口水吧。嗯……多久了？
Paul: Two years.
保罗：两年了。
Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
莫妮卡：哇！真高兴你砸烂了她的表！
Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
保罗：你还想要第五次约会吗？
Monica: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.

[Scene: Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and talking.]
[场景：罗斯的公寓，众人围坐聊天。]
Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
罗斯：（不屑地）抓住勺子。知道我等着“抓住这把勺子”等了多久吗？你对“比利，别逞英雄”这句话有感觉吗？
Joey: Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
乔伊：非常精彩的故事！但我要走了，我有个约会，和安德里亚……安吉拉……安德里亚……嗨，（看向钱德勒）
Chandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
钱德勒：安吉拉喜欢尖叫，安德里亚养猫。
Joey: Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here. (Exits.)
乔伊：对。谢谢。六月份了。我走了。（离开。）
Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
罗斯：是这样的。就算我鼓起勇气约女人出去，但我要约谁呀？（望向窗外。）

瑞秋：神奇吧？我这辈子从没泡过咖啡。
Chandler: That is amazing.
钱德勒：真神奇。
Joey: Congratulations.
乔伊：恭喜了。

瑞秋：你看，我觉得只要我会泡咖啡，就没有什么不行。
Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
钱德勒：如果能侵入波兰，就能征服一切。
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
乔伊：如果你兴致大发想做蛋饼，老实说我不太饿……（乔伊和钱德勒尝了尝咖啡，做了个鬼脸，把咖啡倒进花盆。）
Monica: (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
莫妮卡：（走进来，自言自语）好啊，伦尼和斯奎吉来啦。（注：Lenny和Squigy是经典喜剧《拉维恩和雪莉》中的角色，此处钱德勒和乔伊的行为让莫妮卡联想到这两个角色）

瑞秋：你好，保罗。
Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?

(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice so the others can't hear. The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that they can.)
（莫妮卡和保罗走到门边低声交谈，不让其他人听见。众人把莫妮卡的桌子挪到门边以便偷听。）
Paul: Thank you! Thank you so much!

Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.
莫妮卡：闭嘴，把桌子抬回去。

Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
乔伊：大概没见过吧。我大部份都是在地区性的节目中演出。
Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
莫妮卡：等等，除非你看过“重播剧团”在公园小剧场演出的《木偶奇遇记》。
Joey: Look, it was a job all right?
乔伊：这也算是工作吧？
Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
钱德勒：“瞧，盖佩多，我是个活生生的小男孩。”
Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
乔伊：我不会理睬这种羞辱。（走向门口开门准备离开。）
Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
钱德勒：你说得对，抱歉。（突然唱歌跳舞走出门口）“我曾是个小木偶，一个小小的木偶……”
Joey: You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)
乔伊：告诉你们，他死定了。哦，钱德勒？（追了出去。）
Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
莫妮卡：今天感觉如何？睡得还好吧？和巴瑞通过电话吗？我无法停止笑。
Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
瑞秋：我看得出来。你这样子像是昨晚口中含着衣架睡觉。
Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
莫妮卡：我知道，他是那么……还记得你和东尼·戴马克吗？

瑞秋：需要婚纱吗？几乎没用过的。
Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
莫妮卡：我想我们有点不知所以了。好吧。我要清醒，去工作，整天都不想他，或者只是清醒然后去工作。

瑞秋：祝我幸运！
Monica: What for?

Monica: How do you do that?
莫妮卡：你怎么看出来的？
Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
法兰妮：哦，我恨你，我推着我的洛兹阿姨经过帕罗丛林，你却在做爱！和谁呀？
Monica: You know Paul?
莫妮卡：认识保罗吗？
Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
法兰妮：保罗，那个调酒的？对，我认识保罗。
Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
莫妮卡：你认识保罗像我认识他一样？
Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
法兰妮：爱说笑，他还得谢我呢。遇到我之前他已有两年无法行房。
[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]
[场景：中央公园咖啡馆，除了瑞秋其他人都在。]
Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch) Of course it was a line!
乔伊：（坐在沙发扶手上）显然他是骗你的！
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
莫妮卡：为什么？为什么会有人那样做？
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
罗斯：我想答案比“设法骗你上床”更复杂。
Monica: I hate men! I hate men!
莫妮卡：我恨男人！我恨男人！
Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
菲比：不，别恨，你也不想把他们丢出宇宙吧。
Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
莫妮卡：问题出在我身上？难道我有特殊气味，只有狗和感情有严重问题的男人才闻得到？
Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
菲比：过来，脚给我。（开始给莫妮卡按摩脚。）
Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?
莫妮卡：我以为他是个好男人。
Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
乔伊：（再次大笑）我无法相信你不懂这是骗局。
(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.)
（莫妮卡把乔伊推下沙发，瑞秋提着购物袋走进来。）
Rachel: Guess what?
瑞秋：猜猜看？
Ross: You got a job?
罗斯：你找到工作了？
Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
瑞秋：开玩笑？我什么技能都没有！今天的十二个面试全泡汤了。
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
钱德勒：不过你却异常兴奋。
Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
瑞秋：换成是你，如果你遇见约翰和大卫的皮靴打五折，你也会一样。
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...
钱德勒：你真是太了解我了。
Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
瑞秋：这是我的新皮靴，我不需要工作，不需要父母，因为我有新皮靴！
Monica: How'd you pay for them?
莫妮卡：你怎么付钱的？
Rachel: Uh, credit card.
瑞秋：信用卡啊。
Monica: And who pays for that?
莫妮卡：卡费谁付？
Rachel: Um... my... father.
瑞秋：我爸。
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table. Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]
[场景：莫妮卡和瑞秋的公寓，众人围坐在厨房餐桌旁。瑞秋的信用卡和一把剪刀摊在桌上。]
Rachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
瑞秋：天啊，好啦，有必要吗？我是说，我可以随时忍住挥霍的。
Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
莫妮卡：成熟点，你不能靠你爸一辈子。
Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.
瑞秋：我知道，所以我选择结婚。
Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
菲比：饶了她吧，第一次独立并不轻松。
Rachel: Thank you.
瑞秋：谢谢。
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
菲比：不客气。我记得我第一次来到纽约时的情况，当时我十四岁，我妈刚自杀，我继父再度入狱，我在这儿人生地不熟。最后我和患白化症的男人同居，他为港务局的人清洗车窗，后来他自杀了，然后我找到芳香按摩治疗的工作。所以请相信我，你的心情我能体会。
(Pause)
（停顿）
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
罗斯：你需要的是“无论如何”……
Monica: All right, you ready?
莫妮卡：好的，准备好了吗？
Rachel: No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
瑞秋：不。不，不，我没准备好！我怎么会准备好呢？“嗨，瑞秋！你准备好不用降落伞跳出飞机吗？”不行，我不行！
Monica: You can, I know you can!
莫妮卡：你能行的，我知道你能行！
Rachel: I don't think so.
瑞秋：我不觉得。
Ross: Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
罗斯：来吧，你会泡咖啡！你就什么都可以！（钱德勒慢慢把早上被他和乔伊倒了咖啡而枯死的植物藏起来。）
Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
罗斯：来，剪，剪，剪，剪……
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
众人：剪，剪，剪，剪，剪，剪，剪……（瑞秋剪了一张卡，众人欢呼。）
Rachel: Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
瑞秋：你们知道吗？我认为我们可以把它们留在那里。只做个象征性的姿势就可以了。
Monica: Rachel! That was a library card!
莫妮卡：瑞秋！那是借书卡！
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
众人：剪，剪，剪，剪，剪，剪，剪……
Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
钱德勒：（瑞秋剪卡时）知道吗，如果你们仔细听，你们会听到上千的商家在尖叫。
(She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)

莫妮卡：那是保罗的手表。放回原地就好了。好。晚安，各位。
Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.

Rachel: Okay.
瑞秋：行。
Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
罗斯：好。（两人把饼干掰开。）你大概不知道，我高中时，特别迷你。
Rachel: I knew.
瑞秋：我知道。
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
罗斯：你知道？哦……我总想你认为我不过是莫妮卡的书呆子哥哥。
Rachel: I did.
瑞秋：没错。
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
罗斯：哦。你是否认为——如果抛开我这强烈的脆弱感——我能偶尔约你出去吗？有时？有可能？
Rachel: Yeah, maybe...
瑞秋：好，或许吧……
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...
罗斯：或许我会的……
Rachel: Goodnight.
瑞秋：晚安。
Ross: Goodnight.
罗斯：晚安。
(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)
（瑞秋走进房间，罗斯离开时莫妮卡走进客厅。）
Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
莫妮卡：回头见……等等，你怎么了？
