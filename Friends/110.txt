Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
罗斯：对啊。卡萝离开后，公寓里挺安静的，所以……
Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
莫妮卡：那你为什么不找个室友呢？
Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
罗斯：不了，我不知道……我觉得人到了一定年纪，找室友就有点可悲——（意识到说错话）……抱歉，那是“帕特”，梵语里是“超酷的生活方式”的意思。

Max: No. No, that's- that's okay.

David: Yuh.
大卫：你说。
Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
菲比：嗯，你打算过要吻我吗？

大卫：呃，这绝对是个，呃，合理的问题。而且，呃，答案是（在白板上写下“是”）是的。我打算过。但是，你看，我想让它成为一个非凡的吻，发生在非凡的时刻，因为，嗯，因为是你。
Phoebe: Sure.
菲比：好吧。
David: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
大卫：对。但是，你看，我等得越久，这个吻就必须越非凡，现在已经到了那种地步，我得……把桌上所有东西都扫掉，然后把你按在桌上吻。而且，呃，我其实不是那种，呃，会“横扫桌面”的人。
Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
菲比：哦，大卫，我觉得你就是那种会“横扫桌面”的人。我是说，你骨子里就是个“横扫型”的！……只是被困在了物理学家的身体里。

David: Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)
大卫：好，好，好。（准备扫东西，然后拿起一台笔记本电脑）这个太贵了。（把它放到别的地方。然后拿起一台显微镜）这个是礼物，我得收好。（移开它）
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
菲比：好吧，你现在只是在整理而已。
David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
大卫：好吧，管他呢，管他呢。（把桌上剩下的纸扫掉，抓住菲比）你想让我真的把你按下去，还是你自己跳上去？
Phoebe: I can hop. (She hops onto the table)

And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
瑞秋：不是。好吧。我在机场正要上出租车，有个女人——一个拿着手提包的金发大块头——开始对我大喊大叫。说那辆出租车是她先拦到的。然后她突然开始——开始扯我的头发！我就吹我的防狼哨，又过来三辆出租车，我正要上其中一辆，她把我扑倒了。我的头撞到了路缘石，嘴唇被哨子划破了……哦……大家在派对上玩得开心吗？（对莫妮卡）有人吃我做的蘸酱吗？

Ross: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
