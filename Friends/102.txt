[Scene: Central Perk, everyone's there.]
[场景：中央公园咖啡馆，众人都在。]
Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
莫妮卡：你们男生不懂亲吻对女生的重要性。
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
乔伊：没错，当真？
Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
菲比：当真。
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
瑞秋：你想了解的一切全在初吻之中。
Monica: Absolutely.
莫妮卡：没错。
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
钱德勒：对我们而言亲吻就像是开场，就像佛洛依德飞船出场前，你得耐着性子先看完脱口秀。
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
罗斯：对，我们并非讨厌脱口秀，但那不是我们买票的原因。
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
钱德勒：问题出在于演唱会结束后，不论表演有多精采，你们女生总还想再看脱口秀，我们在车上奋力杀出车阵，只是拼命让自己别睡着。
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
瑞秋：是哦？给你一个建议。叫脱口秀主持人再度上场，否则下次，你们只能坐家里听唱片。
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
乔伊：（停顿）我们还在谈论性吗？

Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
钱德勒：她似乎不急着离开，人和人之间，让人讨厌的就是有误会，他们之间有误会。
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
菲比：我看过这一集！（关掉电视。）
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
莫妮卡：（从乔伊手中拿过饮料）你喝完没？
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
乔伊：抱歉，吞下去的时间太慢了。
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!
莫妮卡：这是谁的小纸团？！
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
钱德勒：我的。我写给自己一张便条，后来觉得不需要，于是揉成纸团，现在我不想活了。
(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)
（莫妮卡开始拍松枕头。）
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
菲比：她已经拍松过那个枕头了……摩妮卡，你已经拍过那个枕头了——（莫妮卡瞪着她）——不过，没关系！
Monica: Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
莫妮卡：抱歉，各位，我只是不想让他们有藉题发挥的机会。
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
钱德勒：没错，我们都知道父母对孩子的枕头要求有多苛刻。
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
菲比：摩妮卡——嗨！嗯，摩妮卡，你吓到我了。你慌慌张张的，而且不是那种好的慌张。
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
乔伊：冷静点，你没见过每次他们来，罗斯有慌张的样子。
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
莫妮卡：因为在我爸妈心目中，罗斯不可能犯错。他是个王子，显然他们在我出生前有个大型仪式。

瑞秋：天啊，天啊，天啊天啊天啊天啊……（开始在沙发垫下寻找。）
Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that!
菲比：嘿，不要动它们！
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
瑞秋：明天就要还他戒指，我似乎还不够担心。嗨，巴瑞！记得我吗？我是那个穿白纱，在你全家面前伤透你心的女孩！天啊，如今我必须还他戒指，可戒指不见了，这让事情难上加难……
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
莫妮卡：别急，瑞秋，我们会找到的。（对众人）对不对！

Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
瑞秋：我今天早上还戴着它，我在厨房戴着做……
Chandler: ...Dinah?
钱德勒：……面条？
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
瑞秋：（看着千层面，突然意识到）哦——，别生气……
Monica: You didn't.
莫妮卡：你不会吧。
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry...
瑞秋：对不起……
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examine the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
莫妮卡：我就让你做了这么一件事！（开始透过玻璃烤盘底部检查千层面。）
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
瑞秋：你看面条现在变得多直！
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
钱德勒：摩妮卡，在千层面中找订婚戒指不是那样找的……
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
莫妮卡：（放下千层面）我办不到。
Chandler: Boys? We're going in.
钱德勒：兄弟们？我们上。
(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the door which Monica answers.)
（钱德勒、乔伊和菲比开始翻找千层面，这时有人敲门，莫妮卡去开门。）
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi.
罗斯：（站在门外）……嗨。
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.
莫妮卡：哇，这可不是开心的问候。
Ross: Carol's pregnant.
罗斯：卡萝怀孕了。
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
菲比：（众人都愣住时）哦！我找到了！
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
莫妮卡：什、什、什……什……什、什、什……
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)
罗斯：对。你再这样持续两小时，就会变成我现在这样。（走进来。）
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
钱德勒：如此一来，枕头的事就可以先放一放了，对吧，摩妮卡？
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
瑞秋：那你现在要怎么融入这件事？
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved basically it's entirely up to me.
罗斯：卡萝说她和苏珊想让我加入，但如果我对此感到不舒服，也可以不加入，基本上一切由我决定。
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.
菲比：她人真好！我真想念她。
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?
莫妮卡：她所谓的“加入”是什么意思？
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
钱德勒：我猜，你大部分的“工作”已经完成了。
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
罗斯：总之，她们想让我明天和她们一起去做超音波检查。
Rachel: So what are you gonna do?
瑞秋：你打算怎么做？
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
罗斯：我不知道。但不管我怎么做，我还是孩子的爹。
(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)
（乔伊开始吃剩下的千层面，众人都转头盯着他。）

盖勒太太：她刚毕业，想找份和烹饪、美食相关的工作吧，我不太清楚。总之，我告诉她你开了一家餐馆——
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
莫妮卡：不，妈，我没开餐馆，我在餐厅工作。
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)

Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
莫妮卡：罗斯，能帮我做义大利面吗？
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
罗斯：好。（两人走向厨房。）
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
盖勒太太：哦，我们吃义大利面呀？这也……太简单了。
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
莫妮卡：我知道这样说会显得非常自私，但你打算和他们说一下孩子/女同性恋之类的事吗？因为这样可以让我喘口气。

莫妮卡：你这话是什么意思？
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.
盖勒太太：没什么！只是随便说说。
Monica: No it's not.
莫妮卡：不，不是的。
Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
盖勒先生：别听你妈乱讲。你一直都很独立，从来都是！就连你小时候，胖嘟嘟的，一个朋友也没有，你还是活得好好的！你会一个人待在房间里看书、玩拼图……
[Time Lapse.]
[时间流逝。]
Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
盖勒先生：你看，有些人像罗斯一样，需要追求卓越，比如他的博物馆工作、发表论文。另一些人则安于现状——我跟你说，这种人从来不会得癌症。
[Time Lapse.]
[时间流逝。]
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
盖勒先生：……我还看到有些女人想拥有一切，真庆幸我们家的“小摩妮卡”似乎没有这种问题。
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
莫妮卡：（拼命想转移话题）那么，罗斯，你呢？最近有什么新鲜事？（用胳膊肘戳他的手。）没什么新闻、没什么小趣事要跟爸妈分享吗？
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
罗斯：（抽回手）好吧！好吧。（对父母）听着，我知道你们一直想知道我和卡萝之间到底怎么了，事情是这样的：卡萝是个女同志，她和一个叫苏珊的女人同居，她怀了我的孩子，并且打算和苏珊一起抚养这个孩子。
(Stunned silence ensues.)

罗斯：你要知道，这些人可专业了，他们知道自己在做什么，慢慢来，总能达到目的。
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
莫妮卡：常言道，父母是无法选择的……可如果可以，（对罗斯）我真想换你的父母。
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
罗斯：我要去尿尿了。（起身离开。）
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
菲比：如果你是双胞胎，情况会更糟。
Rachel: You're twins?
瑞秋：你是双胞胎？
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
菲比：对，我们不往来。她是那种一心扑在事业上、野心勃勃的人。

Phoebe: She's a waitress.

Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)

罗斯：嗯……
Rachel: A lot.
瑞秋：非常紧张。
Ross: Mm.
罗斯：嗯。
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
瑞秋：那你有什么建议吗？作为一个最近刚被甩的人？
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
罗斯：嗯，你或许应该避免用“甩”这个字眼。他现在可能已经心碎成渣了，所以你尽量别显得太光彩照人，我知道这很难。或者，呃，要不这样！我去把戒指还给巴瑞，你陪卡萝和苏珊去妇产科……
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
瑞秋：哦，你明天要陪卡萝……事情怎么变得这么复杂？

瑞秋：我是说，你没想过自己会遇见一个人，坠入爱河——然后就一辈子在一起吗？（罗斯凝视着她。）……罗斯？
Ross: Yes, yes!
罗斯：想过，当然想过！
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
瑞秋：哦！天啊，我从没想过自己会沦落到这种地步……（她向后靠，碰到了罗斯的手。）
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)
罗斯：我也没想过……（他拉过一张凳子坐下，这样就不用挪开手了。）

苏珊：哦，不，不行不行不行，你看他的心思！他知道没人会叫她全名，最后大家都会叫她盖勒，这样他就得逞了！
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
罗斯：我得逞？你觉得这是我想要的结果？相信我，我这辈子设想过无数种此刻的场景，绝对不是现在这样——算了，这太难了，我做不到——
